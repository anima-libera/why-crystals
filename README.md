# Why Chystals ?

I started in C ([here](https://github.com/anima-libera/WhyCrystals)) but Rust is just too good.

This is a wannabe roguelike-like-lite-thingy game with focus on procedural jungle stuff and all.

Still in very early development, you should come back later for more.

## Dependencies

For now the `SDL2` and `SDL2_image` must be installed, as the `sdl2` crate is but a nice and Rusty interface to the SDL2 C library.
